# Implementation Plan - API Contracts Generation

## Goal
Generate `docs/08-api-contracts.md` containing complete API contracts for all services as defined in the Canonical System Specification and Phased Execution Plan.

## User Review Required
None explicitly, but stricter adherence to the canonical spec is required.

## Proposed Changes
### Documentation
#### [NEW] [08-api-contracts.md](file:///c:/Users/LAKSHMI_NARAYANA/AI_Real_Time_Content_Collaboration/docs/08-api-contracts.md)
- Will contain API definitions for:
    - Auth Service
    - Document Service
    - Collaboration Service
    - AI Service
    - Export Service
    - Search Service

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Cross-reference each generated endpoint with [docs/00-canonical-system-spec.md](file:///c:/Users/LAKSHMI%20NARAYANA/AI%20Real%20Time%20Content%20Collaboration/docs/00-canonical-system-spec.md) to ensure no invention of endpoints or fields.
- Verify adherence to JSON Schema-like notation.
